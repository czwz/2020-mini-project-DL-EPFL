## -Project 3: Mini deep-learning framework

It is the python code to implement the modules such as 
```diff
linear (fully connected layer), 
sigmoid (Tanh), 
optimizer_sgd (stochastic gradient descent),
criterion_mse (mean square error),
```
and to combine above several modules in a basic sequential structure.

- Content
```diff
-test.py: main executable
-mynn_module.py: module library to be imported
```

- Usage:
```diff
$ python test.py
```
